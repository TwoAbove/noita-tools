# Noitool

A web app for many things Noita.

Helps you get a specific seed for your specific needs.

Current features include:

- Holy mountain info
- Shop type and contents
- Pacifist chest contents
- Perks and perk rerolls
- Starting setup
- Water Cave layout
- Lively Concoction and Alchemic Precursor recipes
- Fungal Shifts
- Live seed checking during play using machine learning computer vision
- Seed search with customizable complexity

## Connecting as a compute node

### Prerequisites

- The machine should have node installed (ideally v18.6+) and npm.
- Follow to <https://www.noitool.com/?profile=true> and link your patreon account. Under your patreon username, there will now be an id like `6456aff2478c4f8f91701018`

### Installing and connecting

#### Docker

You can use docker to simply spin up a compute node:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/twoabove/noitool-console-search:latest && docker run -it ghcr.io/twoabove/noitool-console-search:latest --userId xxx
# Or for dev
docker pull ghcr.io/twoabove/noitool-console-search:latest-dev && docker run -it ghcr.io/twoabove/noitool-console-search:latest-dev --userId xxx --url https://dev.noitool.com/
```

#### CLI

To connect to noitool as a compute node, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TwoAbove/noita-tools.git
cd noita-tools
git checkout master # for https://www.noitool.com
# git checkout develop # for https://dev.noitool.com
npm install --frozen-lockfile
npm run console-build
npm run console-search --userId 6456aff2478c4f8f91701018
```

console-search args (or env vars):

- `--url` `NOITOOL_URL`: default <https://www.noitool.com/>. Change to <https://dev.noitool.com/> for the dev build
- `--cores` `NOITOOL_CORES`: default `os.cpus()`. The amount of threads to use.
- `--userId` `NOITOOL_USER_ID`: The user to connect as.
- `--exit` `NOITOOL_EXIT` default `false`. Add if you want the worker to exit if there are no more jobs.
- `--minRunTime` `NOITOOL_MIN_RUN_TIME` default `0`. This minimum amount of time (in seconds) that the worker will run for. If there are no more jobs, it will exit after this time. A value of 0 means that this is disabled.

## Technical details and implementation details that I found interesting

WASM is shaping up to be a very interesting technology. In our use-case, the communication overhead of JS <-> WASM is usually worth it,
but it's the main vector of performance improvements, since we're constantly bouncing between JS and WASM for noita_random calls.

Many parts of the critical core game functions that are needed to generate everything are written in C++.
The c++ code is then compiled to wasm and is run in web workers (and partly in the main thread).
The performance improvements are 20-fold by transferring seed functions (like randoms and lc & ap recipes) from a typescript implementation to c++, even with the call overhead from worker -> wasm code.

For map generation, [wang tiles](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_herringbone_wang_tile.h) are used. In lua/xml code, **A**RGB color formats are used for color targeting. In browsers, in general, RGB**A** is used. The transformed colors (in data json) use RGB**A** to homogenize color format.

Credits to the developers of similar tools:
The code for finding LC and AP values was transferred from [noita_unicorn](https://github.com/SaphireLattice/noita_unicorn)'s `Program.cs` from c# to c++.
Also, I took inspiration from [cr4xy](https://cr4xy.dev/noita/) for extra features. You rock! <3

## Development

Prerequisites:

- [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) is installed
- `npm i -g google-closure-compiler`
- Node

After extracting noita wak, run

```sh
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/----------------------//g' {} +;
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/<!------------ MATERIALS -------------------->/<!-- MATERIALS -->/g' {} +;
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/<!------------ MATERIALS ------------------ -->/<!-- MATERIALS -->/g' {} +;
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/<!-- attack_ranged_min_distance="60" -->//g' {} +;
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/<!---------------- shield ---------------- -->//g' {} +;
find . -type f -not -path '*/\.*' -exec sed -i 's/<!-- fuse_tnt durability is 11 so this is capable of destroying it -->//g' {} +;
tac $NOLLA_PATH/entities/misc/eradicate.xml | sed '0,/<Entity>$/s//<\/Entity>/' | tac >$NOLLA_PATH/entities/misc/eradicate.xml;
```

to fix comments for the xml parser

For emscripten, some edits need to be done to enable the closure compiler:

### emscripten installation and required changes

I recommend using the git repo to install emsdk. Install the latest version.

After, there are a small amount of changes that might need to be done:

- /usr/share/emscripten/tools/building.py

Here, go to line ~888
Verify that this is there:

```py
def get_closure_compiler():
  # First check if the user configured a specific CLOSURE_COMPILER in thier settings
  if config.CLOSURE_COMPILER:
    return config.CLOSURE_COMPILER
```

- ~/.emscripten

Add the closure compiler path to the config.

```py
CLOSURE_COMPILER = ["<path to prefix>/bin/google-closure-compiler"]
```

To get the prefix, run:

```sh
npm config get prefix
```

Installation (after emscripten): `npm i`

Running: `npm run dev`

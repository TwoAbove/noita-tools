# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the most recent version (that is on `master` branch) is supported and all fixed will be made to that branch as well as `develop`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you found a vulnerability, send me an email me@seva.dev with the title `Noitool - x` so that I know it's for this app. Thank you for the proactivity!
